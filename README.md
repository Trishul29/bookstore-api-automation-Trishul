📚 Bookstore API Automation with CI/CD Integration

Overview

This project automates end-to-end API testing of a Bookstore application using Cucumber BDD and TestNG in Java with Rest Assured.

💻 Tech Stack Overview

Component	Description
🧠 IDE	IntelliJ IDEA
☕ Language	Java 11+
🔄 Framework	Rest Assured + Cucumber BDD – For behavior-driven API automation
🛠 Build Tool	Maven – Dependency management and CI/CD integration
✅ Test Execution	TestNG – For parallel execution, retries, and robust test orchestration (Can be Implemented for future Sscope with Cucumber Integration)
📊 Reporting	Allure Report – For detailed visual test reports with failure categorization and trends

🧪 Why This Stack?
TestNG over JUnit:
Better suited for non-Spring Boot projects, offers flexible test orchestration, retries, and parallel runs.

Rest Assured + Cucumber:
Provides readable BDD-style tests, making scenarios easy to understand and maintain.
Seperate Test Layer, Client Layer, and Service Layer. This separation helps keep  code clean, maintainable, and hides implementation details.

Allure Reporting:
Generates rich reports with detailed test steps, failure categories, and history.

Maven:
Manages dependencies and facilitates easy CI/CD pipeline integration.

🚀 Features & Endpoints Covered
This automation covers the following REST endpoints:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/signup	Register a new user
POST	/login	Authenticate user & get token
POST	/books	Create a new book
PUT	/books/{id}	Update book by ID
GET	/books/{id}	Fetch book details by ID
GET	/books	Fetch all books
DELETE	/books/{id}	Delete a book by ID

🔧 How to Set Up & Run the Project
Prerequisites
Java 11+

Maven 3.6+

IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE

Running Tests
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
Run tests via Maven:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test
Generate and open Allure reports:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn allure:serve
🎯 CI/CD Integration
Prerequisites
Jenkins installed with required plugins: Git, Maven, Pipeline, Allure



Ngrok (for local development webhook exposure)



Sample Jenkins Pipeline for QA Automation
groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    tools { 
        maven 'Maven 3.6.3'
        allure 'Allure' 
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/Trishul29/bookstore-api-automation-Trsihul.git', branch: 'main'
            }
        }
        stage('Build and Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean test'
            }
        }
        stage('Generate Allure Report') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn allure:report'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            allure([ includeProperties: false, jdk: '', results: [[path: 'target/allure-results']] ])
        }
    }
}


Development Workflow with Jenkins & Ngrok
Set up Jenkins jobs for your Dev and QA repos.

Use Ngrok to expose local servers for webhook triggers:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 8080
Configure GitHub webhook with the Ngrok URL for Jenkins to trigger builds on commits.

Commit changes → Dev Jenkins job builds → On success, triggers QA automation job → Allure reports generated.

🔑 Key Benefits
Automated tests ensure API stability on every commit.

BDD-style tests improve collaboration between devs, QAs, and stakeholders.

Detailed reports help quickly identify issues.

CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous testing and faster feedback.
